# NC State GIS week: Big Data Computing with GRASS

This repository contains materials in the form of Jupyter notebooks for 2023 GIS week at NC State.
The content is adapted from [OpenGeoHub 2023: Parallelization of geoprocessing workflows in GRASS GIS and Python](https://github.com/ncsu-geoforall-lab/opengeohub-2023).

## Running in a cloud environment
The workshop can be run online in [WholeTale](https://wholetale.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). This is a convenient way, since no installation is needed, however, there are resource limitations, e.g., Colab will give you only 2 cpus.

### WholeTale
WholeTale is a scalable, open source, web-based platform for reproducible research.

1. Go to https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/64c96871e6fabc2991d17f94
2. Log in (there are different options)
3. Run Tale (blue button at the top right)
4. Confirm Copy and Run Tale
5. If it keeps showing Importing... try to reload
6. Run Tale

### Google Colab

In Colab:
1. File-> Open notebook
2. Select Github
3. Paste https://github.com/ncsu-geoforall-lab/grass-workshop-gis-week-2023/blob/main/colab_notebook.ipynb

In Google Colab we don't have pre-installed the software needed, so go ahead and execute the first part to install it. Also, in order to avoid repeating the installation, we merged both notebooks into one.
